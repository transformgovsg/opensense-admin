# Environment Variables Documentation

üîê Means the value should be treated as a secret.

## Application Configuration

### APP_HOST
Example Value: 0.0.0.0
The host IP address on which the application listens. 0.0.0.0 allows connections from any IP address. Typically in a docker container you may want to keep 0.0.0.0.

### APP_PORT
Example Value: 8051
The port number on which the application listens for incoming connections.

### NODE_ENV
Example Value: production
Specifies the runtime environment for Node.js. 'production' typically enables optimizations and disables development-specific features. To keep Admin.js code bundling functionality working correctly, please leave it to production in production. This is NOT OPTIONAL.

### LOG_LEVEL
Example Value: error
Sets the minimum severity of log messages to be recorded. 'error' logs only error messages and omits less severe levels.

## Authentication and Security

### OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
The unique identifier for the application registered with the OAuth2 provider.

### OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET üîê
The secret key associated with the OAuth2 client ID, used to authenticate the application to the OAuth2 provider.

Example Value: https://xxxx.auth.ap-southeast-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize
The URL used to initiate the OAuth2 authorization process.

### OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL
Example Value: https://xxxx.auth.ap-southeast-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token

The URL to which the OAuth2 provider redirects after successful authentication. Please ensure to put your actual domain.

A secret key used to sign the session ID cookie to prevent tampering. These value should be different than COOKIE_PASSWORD. 32 Characters recommended.
